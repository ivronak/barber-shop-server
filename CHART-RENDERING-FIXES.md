# Chart Rendering Fixes

## Issues Identified

1. **Layout Overflow**: Charts were overflowing their parent containers vertically
2. **Chart Not Rendering**: After fixing the layout overflow, charts stopped rendering properly
3. **Responsive Container Issues**: The ResponsiveContainer component wasn't adapting correctly to its parent

## Root Causes

1. **Nested Card Components**: The ComparisonChart component was wrapping its content in another Card component, creating nested cards
2. **Fixed Height**: The ResponsiveContainer had a fixed height (300px) but was inside a container with percentage height
3. **Missing Minimum Height**: Without a minimum height, the chart container would collapse when parent dimensions weren't explicitly set
4. **Padding Issues**: Insufficient padding in the card content was causing chart elements to be cut off

## Implemented Fixes

### 1. Simplified ComparisonChart Component
```tsx
// Before: Wrapped in Card components with fixed height
<Card className={className}>
  <CardHeader>
    <CardTitle className="text-base font-medium">{title}</CardTitle>
  </CardHeader>
  <CardContent>
    <ResponsiveContainer width="100%" height={300}>
      {/* chart content */}
    </ResponsiveContainer>
  </CardContent>
</Card>

// After: Simple div with minimum height and responsive height
<div className={`w-full h-full min-h-[250px] ${className || ''}`}>
  {title && <div className="text-base font-medium mb-2">{title}</div>}
  <ResponsiveContainer width="100%" height="100%">
    {/* chart content */}
  </ResponsiveContainer>
</div>
```

### 2. Improved Container Styling
```tsx
// Before
<CardContent className="h-80 overflow-hidden">
  {renderRevenueChart()}
</CardContent>

// After: Added proper padding
<CardContent className="h-80 overflow-hidden p-4">
  {renderRevenueChart()}
</CardContent>

// Before
<CardContent className="px-2 h-80 overflow-hidden">
  <div className="h-full">
    {renderTipsDiscountsChart()}
  </div>
</CardContent>

// After: Improved padding
<CardContent className="px-4 py-4 h-80 overflow-hidden">
  <div className="h-full">
    {renderTipsDiscountsChart()}
  </div>
</CardContent>
```

## Key Principles Applied

1. **Avoid Nested Layout Components**: Removed nested Card components that caused layout issues
2. **Use Relative + Minimum Heights**: Combined percentage heights with minimum heights to ensure charts render properly
3. **Consistent Padding**: Added proper padding to prevent chart axes and labels from being cut off
4. **Simplified Component Structure**: Reduced the number of nested containers for better layout control

## Testing

To verify the fixes:
1. Check that charts render properly within their containers
2. Verify that no chart elements (axes, labels, legends) are cut off
3. Test responsiveness by resizing the browser window
4. Ensure charts maintain proper aspect ratios at different screen sizes
