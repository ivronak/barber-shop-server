# Day of Week Standardization - Summary of Changes

## Problem

The barber shop booking system had inconsistent day-of-week representations across different parts of the application:

- Some parts used numeric values (0-6, where 0 = Sunday, 1 = Monday)
- Other parts used string values ('sunday', 'monday', etc.)
- This inconsistency caused a bug where setting Monday as unavailable incorrectly showed Tuesday as unavailable in the booking interface

## Solution

We standardized the day-of-week representation across the entire system:

1. Created a utility helper (`dayOfWeekUtils.js`) with functions for day-of-week conversions
2. Updated models to use consistent string ENUM format
3. Modified controllers to use string day names consistently
4. Updated the database schema to use string ENUM values for the `day_of_week` column in the `breaks` table

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Utility Helper

Created `src/utils/dayOfWeekUtils.js` with functions:
- `getDayNameFromNumber(dayNumber)`: Converts numeric day to string day name
- `getDayNumberFromName(dayName)`: Converts string day name to numeric day
- `getDayNameFromDate(date)`: Gets day name from a Date object
- And other utility functions

### 2. Updated Models

Updated the `Break` model to use string ENUM values for `day_of_week`:
```javascript
day_of_week: {
  type: DataTypes.ENUM('sunday', 'monday', 'tuesday', 'wednesday', 'thursday', 'friday', 'saturday'),
  allowNull: true
}
```

### 3. Modified Controllers

Updated controllers to use string day names consistently:
- Staff controller (`updateWorkingHours`)
- Settings controller (`updateBreak`, `batchUpdateBusinessHoursAndBreaks`)
- Public controller (`getAvailableSlots`)
- Appointments controller (`getAvailableSlots`)
- PublicBooking controller (`getBookingSlots`)

### 4. Database Schema Changes

Created a migration to:
- Add `staff_id` to the `breaks` table
- Make `business_hour_id` nullable
- Convert the `day_of_week` column from integer to string ENUM

### 5. Documentation

Created documentation files:
- `DAY-OF-WEEK-STANDARDIZATION.md`: Detailed explanation of the standardization
- `DAY-OF-WEEK-STANDARDIZATION-SUMMARY.md`: Summary of changes (this file)

## Testing

Created test scripts to verify the standardization:
- `test-day-of-week-standardization.js`: Tests creating and finding breaks with string day values

## Results

- The day-of-week representation is now consistent across the entire system
- The bug where setting Monday as unavailable incorrectly showed Tuesday as unavailable is fixed
- The system now correctly handles day-of-week values in all parts of the application
