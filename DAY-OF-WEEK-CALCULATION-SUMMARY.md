# Day of Week Calculation Fix Summary

## Problem

There was an inconsistency in how the day of week was calculated and used across different controllers and models:

1. The `WorkingHour` model stores `day_of_week` as a string enum ('monday', 'tuesday', etc.)
2. The `Break` model stores `day_of_week` as a number (0 = Sunday, 1 = Monday, etc.)
3. Different controllers were using different methods to calculate the day of week
4. This was causing a mismatch when closing a week day in the admin settings

## Solution

### 1. Created a Centralized Helper Function

Added a new helper function `getConsistentDayOfWeek` in `appointment.utils.js`:

```javascript
function getConsistentDayOfWeek(date) {
  // Ensure we have a Date object
  const dateObj = date instanceof Date ? date : new Date(date);
  
  // Get numeric day of week (0 = Sunday, 1 = Monday, etc.)
  const numericDayOfWeek = dateObj.getDay();
  
  // Map to string day name as used in the database
  const dayNames = ['sunday', 'monday', 'tuesday', 'wednesday', 'thursday', 'friday', 'saturday'];
  const dayOfWeek = dayNames[numericDayOfWeek];
  
  return { dayOfWeek, numericDayOfWeek };
}
```

### 2. Updated Controllers to Use the Helper Function

Updated the following controllers to use the new helper function:

- `publicBooking.controller.js` - Updated `getBookingSlots` and `createBooking` functions
- `appointments.controller.js` - Updated `getAvailableSlots` function
- `public.controller.js` - Updated `getAvailableSlots` function
- `appointment.utils.js` - Updated `checkAvailability` and `generateTimeSlots` functions

### 3. Fixed Staff Controller Day of Week Handling

Updated the staff controller to handle day of week values consistently:

- In `updateWorkingHours` function:
  - Added proper conversion from numeric to string day names for `WorkingHour` model
  - Added improved conversion from string to numeric day values for `Break` model
  - Used a consistent mapping approach with a day map object

- In `createStaffBreak` and `updateStaffBreak` functions:
  - Updated the day of week conversion to use the same consistent approach
  - Improved validation for day of week values

### 4. Ensured Consistent Day of Week Handling

- For `WorkingHour` model: Using string day names (e.g., 'monday') returned by `dayOfWeek`
- For `Break` model: Using numeric day values (e.g., 1 for Monday) returned by `numericDayOfWeek`
- Removed all direct calculations like `new Date(date).getDay()` and replaced with the helper function
- Removed all manual mappings from numeric days to string days
- Added consistent validation for day of week values

### 5. Created Test Scripts

- Created `test-day-of-week-fixed.js` to verify the fix in the booking controllers
- Created `test-staff-day-of-week-fix.js` to verify the fix in the staff controller
- Tests all days of the week to ensure consistent calculation
- Confirms that the string day names and numeric day values are correctly mapped

## Benefits

1. **Consistency**: Day of week calculation is now consistent across all parts of the application
2. **Fixed Mismatch**: Resolved the issue with day mismatches when closing week days
3. **Maintainability**: Centralized the day of week calculation logic for easier maintenance
4. **Clarity**: Clear separation between string day names and numeric day values
5. **Validation**: Improved validation for day of week values in all controllers

## Testing

The fix was verified by running the test scripts, which test all days of the week and confirm that the day of week calculation is consistent across all controllers.

## Next Steps

1. Consider standardizing the `day_of_week` field across all models in a future update
2. Add more comprehensive validation to ensure consistent day of week handling
3. Add unit tests for the day of week calculation function
