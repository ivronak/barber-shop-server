# Staff Login Issue - Fix Summary

## Issue Description

Staff members were unable to login with their credentials, while admin users could login successfully. The specific error was:

```json
{"success":false,"message":"Invalid credentials"}
```

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Password Mismatch**: The password stored in the database didn't match what the user was entering
2. **Missing Staff Records**: Some staff users didn't have corresponding records in the staff table
3. **Frontend Issues**: The frontend wasn't properly handling staff details in the login response

## Backend Fixes Implemented

1. **Password Reset**: 
   - Created a script to reset the password for the specific user (Joj@barber.com)
   - Set the password to match the email for easier testing

2. **Staff Record Creation**:
   - Modified the auth controller to automatically create staff records if they don't exist
   - Added detailed logging to help diagnose authentication issues

3. **Login Response Enhancement**:
   - Updated the login endpoint to include staff details in the response
   - Added better error handling and logging

## Frontend Fixes Implemented

1. **Form Submission Handling**:
   - Updated the Login component to prevent default form submission behavior
   - Added explicit event prevention to avoid page refreshes on errors

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Improved error handling in the API client
   - Added better error messages and logging

3. **Authentication Flow**:
   - Updated the auth module to handle staff-specific data
   - Modified the logout functions to not automatically redirect

## Testing Results

After implementing these fixes, we successfully tested:

1. Login with the Joj@barber.com user works correctly
2. The API returns the proper staff details in the login response
3. The frontend can handle the staff details and navigate to the staff dashboard

## Recommendations for Future

1. **Password Management**:
   - Implement a proper password reset functionality
   - Consider adding password complexity requirements

2. **User Creation Flow**:
   - Ensure staff records are always created when staff users are created
   - Add validation to prevent creation of staff users without staff records

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Continue improving error messages and logging
   - Add more detailed validation for login requests
