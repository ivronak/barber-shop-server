# Staff Dashboard Updates

This document outlines the recent updates made to the staff dashboard to enhance its functionality and align it with the admin dashboard features.

## Added Features

### 1. Appointment Management

- **Today's Appointments**: Staff can now view all appointments scheduled for the current day directly on their dashboard
- **Upcoming Appointments**: Staff can see future appointments in a separate section
- **Appointment Actions**: Staff can now perform the following actions on appointments:
  - View appointment details
  - Update appointment status (confirm, complete, cancel, mark as no-show)
  - Reschedule appointments

### 2. Reschedule Functionality

The staff dashboard now includes a reschedule dialog that allows staff to:
- Select a new date from a calendar view
- View available time slots for the selected date
- Reschedule appointments without leaving the dashboard

This functionality uses the same `RescheduleAppointmentDialog` component used in the admin dashboard, ensuring a consistent user experience across the application.

## Implementation Details

### Frontend Changes

1. **Dashboard Component**:
   - Added state management for reschedule dialog
   - Implemented appointment conversion functions to transform API data to component format
   - Added "View All Appointments" buttons that navigate to the full appointments page

2. **Reschedule Dialog Integration**:
   - Implemented handlers for opening the reschedule dialog
   - Added logic to convert between different appointment data formats
   - Implemented callback for refreshing data after successful reschedule

3. **Data Handling**:
   - Enhanced data processing for appointments
   - Added filtering to separate today's appointments from upcoming appointments

### Data Structure

The staff dashboard now expects the following data structure from the API:

```typescript
interface StaffDashboardData {
  staffInfo: {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    commissionPercentage: number;
  };
  performanceSummary: {
    totalAppointments: number;
    totalCommission: number;
  };
  todayAppointments: UpcomingAppointment[];
  upcomingAppointments: UpcomingAppointment[];
  serviceBreakdown: {
    service_id: string;
    service_name: string;
    bookings: number;
    revenue: number;
  }[];
  staffReviews: {
    id: string;
    rating: number;
    comment: string;
    customer: {
      id: string;
      name: string;
    };
  }[];
}
```

## Future Enhancements

Potential future improvements to the staff dashboard:

1. **Performance Metrics**: Add more detailed performance metrics and visualizations
2. **Calendar View**: Add a calendar view similar to the admin dashboard
3. **Notification System**: Implement notifications for new appointments and changes
4. **Mobile Optimization**: Further optimize the dashboard for mobile devices
